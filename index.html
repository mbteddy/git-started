		<p> 
			Cheerful, courageous and also a bit naive, Goku is a Saiyan originally 
			sent to Earth as an infant with the mission to destroy it. However, an accident 
			alters his memory, causing him to grow up pure-hearted and later become Earth's 
			greatest defender, as well as the informal leader of the Z Fighters. Throughout 
			his life, he trains hard and strives to be the greatest warrior possible, while 
			at the same time using his amazing strength and skills to uphold peace.
